## Matt Nash

I design AI products where evaluation and constraints are the architecture — so the system earns trust before it reaches users.

### What that means in practice

Most AI systems are designed for the happy path. My work focuses on the other cases:

- **Evaluation first.** Define what success and failure look like before the system is built — not after it ships.
- **Constraint specification.** What the system must not do is as important as what it should do. Both get written down.
- **Failure mode mapping.** Failure modes are architectural inputs, not post-launch surprises.
- **Readiness as judgment.** Deployment decisions are grounded in evidence, not optimism. A benchmark pass is not the same as readiness.

### Currently building

| Track | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Evaluation Framework | Principles, metrics taxonomy, and a working eval harness for LLM outputs |
| Constraint Architecture | Gate design patterns and human-in-the-loop enforcement models |
| Failure Mode Taxonomy | Detection patterns and mitigation playbooks for common AI failure classes |
| Working AI System | An eval-first, constraint-aware PRD analyzer |

### Background

15 years in product leadership across SaaS platforms, marketplaces, and DTC brands. I became less interested in feature velocity and more focused on a harder question: *how do you know this system is actually ready to deploy?*

Not whether it clears a benchmark. Whether it works in the context where it will be used — under real conditions, against adversarial inputs, for the people who will depend on it.
